SimpleCocoaApp
==============

SimpleCocoaApp is a small application that is meant to show some of the basic things you can do with Objective-C and Cocoa. This application displays different "Hello Cocoa" dialogs to the user based upon radio-button and PopUp menu selections. The user can change which hello message is sent by selecting a different radio button. The user can change which Hello object receives the message by changing the PopUp menu selection. The dynamic nature of the Objective-C runtime and the power of Cocoa help make this "on-the-fly" code-path execution possible and the GUI easy to program.


Sample Requirements
The supplied Xcode project was created using Xcode v3.2.5.  It's capable of running on Mac OS X 10.1 or later.
